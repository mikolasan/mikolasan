## 👋 Hi, I’m Nikolay

🔬 I'm a scientist. I can read, talk and listen endlessly about game development, DIY electronics, and artificial intelligence. And many people could find me boring because I don't talk about news or politics because I find it boring.

💎 I like [C++](https://cpp-by-example.netlify.app/), but can also tolerate Rust, Python, Kotlin, and Lua

🧲 I enjoy learning the basics of electronics on my own and slowly designing PCBs

🌌 As a mathematician and a curious person, I would never stop asking why, even about core definitions (this month I started with Lebesgue measure)

⚔️ Currently I work on a [3D game in Godot](https://mastodon.social/deck/@mikolasan/112810719012269009), an NPC simulator about a merchant who buys loot and sell potions to your usual RPG adventurers.

🙌 You can find me on Mastodon [@mikolasan](https://mastodon.social/@mikolasan) where I share thoughts about my robot development and cloud photos

☕ Enjoy coding today!
